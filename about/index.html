        <h2>PCB</h2>
        <p>Printed Circuit Board is a vital element of any keyboard, it handles every action that is done on the keyboard,
        and the controller sends it to the PC. PCB is widely used in tons of uses, like simple pendrives, disks, PC PCB's,
        and many more! The PCB's we sell are highest quality, and are on artsian level with ornaments done on them with paths.
        You should start thinking about your keyboard from PCB, it defines its layout. We recommend standard layouts for the
        begginers :)</p>

      <section id="case">
        <h2>Case</h2>
        <p>Keyboard Case cooparates with PCB to create a solid base for further modifications and addictions. You should also
        pick any plate to hold your switches in one place and stop them from wooble. The case makes alot for a preety keyboard,
        so choose it wisely! Cases can have different mounting methods, but as a beginner that shouldn't bother you. Just pick
        the one you like visually. Cases also can be made with many diferent materials, but generally good quality plastic should
        be enough.</p>

      <section id="switches">
        <h2>Switches</h2>
        <p>Keyboard Switches are very likely the most important element of mechanical keyboard. They define most of the
        keyboard feeling. From linear, through tactile or clicky. You can choose any actuatuion force you'd like to use.
        Nowadays there are hunders of switch models from many diferent brands like Cherry, Gateron, Kalih, and many more!
        If you choose hotswap PCB you may exchange them but it's time consuming process and its definitely not cheap.
        So choose them carefully too, like everything you should in your keeb. We sell them in packs of 70.</p>

      <section id="keycaps">
        <h2>Keycaps</h2>
        <p>Keycaps are often thought as the most eye pleasing and the most important element, te first sentence may be true,
        but the second one isn't for sure, but they are important too of course! There are alot of keycap profiles, and the
        worst thing with them is that this subject is 100% subjective, someone might like one profile, and other person might
        dislike it. You'd need to guess or try which one you like. We sell full sets for 100% keyboards just in case.
