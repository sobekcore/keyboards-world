Keyboards World is a example e-commerce website to improve my front-end skills and also learn some new ones. It serves informational and store purposes.

You just download the project and launch local http server and run it in the browser. To use Contentful change space and accesToken id's in store.js file. Alternatively use attached JSON file with all the products listed in a right way, and uncomment 36-38 store.js file lines.
