# Keyboards World ⌨️
Keyboards World is a example e-commerce website to improve my front-end skills. It serves informational and store-like purposes. It's design is modern and uses very few color scheme only.

## How it's made?
Keyboards World is firstly made with plain **`HTML`**, **`CSS`** and **`JavaScript`**. Then fetching products is made with the help of **`Contentful`** CMS and .env enviroment variables, thanks to that is very easy to add new products in seconds in the CMS. In between some of the icons are used with **`Font Awesome`**, which is very simple solution of easy icon usage. Then whole project is bundled and optimized with **`Webpack`** to work as fast and as good as possible. Also some of the work is optimized and automated with **`npm scripts`**. You can launch development enviroment, build or push to production with it. Overall the project is made in a way to be simple, clear, and really fast.

## How to run it?
You just download the project and launch local http-server or Webpack Dev Server and run it in the browser. To use Contentful change **`CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`** and **`CONTENTFUL_ACCES_TOKEN`** values in .env file. Alternatively use attached JSON file with all the products listed in a right way, and uncomment 41-43 **`store.js`** file lines.
